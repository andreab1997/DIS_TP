# DIS_TP
This is the python version of the code I used for my master's thesis. It computes the F2 and FL structure functions for DIS with heavy-quark production at NLO, NNLO and N3LO. It is also able to construct the scale varied result (at the moment only threshold scale variation
is available) and obtain uncertainty bands based on that and on coefficient function uncertainties (at N3LO).

## Installation
The simplest way to install the code is to run

**python -m pip install dis_tp**

which will install the last release, together with all needed dependencies.
The only dependency the user will need to install separately is *lhapdf*.
